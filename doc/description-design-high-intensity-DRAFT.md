# Interactive Description Design — High Intensity Screen

**Quantum Wave Interference** · GENERATED DRAFT v2 · 2026-07-07
Derived from `quantum-wave-interference-strings_en.yaml`, sim + common-code TypeScript, and runtime capture via the interact harness. Do not hand-edit — regenerate.

**How to read this document**

- Collapsed, this document is the structural map of the screen. Every ▶ triangle expands one element's full text and variants. **The summary line always tells you: what it is, when it exists, how many variants (×N), and one example.**
- “Curly-quoted text” is exactly what the user hears. Everything else is document machinery.
- `{650 nanometers}` marks a dynamic fill-in, shown with an example value.
- **[when …]** marks content that exists only under a condition.
- 🔊 marks a spoken response (announced once, when something happens). Everything unmarked is PDOM state (readable on demand, always current).
- **[common: joist]** / **[common: scenery-phet]** / **[common: sun]** marks text authored in shared PhET libraries, not this sim — included here so nothing a learner hears is missing from this document.
- ⚠ marks a confirmed issue found during generation. UNKNOWN marks facts not recoverable from YAML or code — honest gaps, not omissions.
- Shared content used from several places is defined once in [Shared blocks](#shared) and linked, mirroring how the strings themselves are shared.

## Screen Summary

Read first on entering the screen, inside the standard scaffold:

> “The High Intensity Screen changes as you play with it. It has a Play Area and a Control Area.” **[common: joist]**
> … four designed parts below …
> “This screen has custom interactions. If needed, check out keyboard shortcuts under Sim Resources.” **[common: joist]**

**Play Area overview** — static:
“A zoomed-in wave area shows a particle source, double-slit barrier, and detector screen. When the source is on, waves travel through available slits and build a pattern on the detector screen. You can change particle type, slit configuration, wave display, detector view, and measurement tools.”

**Control Area overview** — static (shared by all three screens):
“Measurement tools can be added or removed to assist with data collection and analysis. Reset sim to start over.”

<details><summary><b>Current Details</b> — dynamic, ×10 paths — e.g. “Currently, source is off. Detector screen is empty.”</summary>

“Currently,” … then exactly one path. The paused branch prefixes “sim is paused.” and re-capitalizes; otherwise the four states are shared:

| Path | Rendered text (photon example) |
|---|---|
| **[when max hits]** | “Source is off. Maximum hits reached. Detector screen shows hits pattern.” |
| **[when emitting]** | “Source emits `{photons}` directly at double-slit barrier with `{both slits open}`.” + result below |
| — result, intensity | “Detector screen shows intensity pattern.” — or “Detector screen is empty.” **[when wavefront hasn't reached screen]** |
| — result, hits | “Detector screen shows hits pattern.” — or “Detector screen has no hits.” **[when none yet]** |
| **[when source off]** | “Source is off.” + “Detector screen is empty.” — or “Detector screen shows hits pattern.” **[when leftover hits]** |

Slit clause uses **top/bottom** wording on this screen (“top slit covered”, “detector on bottom slit”, “no barrier”…). On this screen “has pattern” means: intensity → wavefront has actually reached the screen; hits → at least one hit.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Interaction Hint</b> — dynamic, ×2 — e.g. “Turn on photon source and observe detector screen.”</summary>

- **[when source off]** “Turn on `{photon}` source and observe detector screen.” (noun follows particle type)
- **[when source on]** “Adjust source or slits and watch for changes on detector screen.”

### H3 · Detector Screen and Experiment Details

**[when graph view]** the heading reads **“Graph and Experiment Details”** instead.

<details><summary><b>¶ Status paragraph</b> — ×3 + graph variant — e.g. “Detector screen is empty. Photon experiment ready.”</summary>

- **[when empty, nothing traveling]** “`{Detector screen}` is empty. `{Photon}` experiment ready.”
- **[when empty, waves en route]** “`{Detector screen}` is empty.” — the “ready” invitation is deliberately dropped
- **[when pattern present]** “`{Detector screen}` shows `{an intensity pattern}` of a `{photon}` experiment.” ⚠ renders “a **electron**” — article bug
- **[when graph view]** subject becomes “Graph”

`a11y.experimentDetectorScreenDetails.leadingParagraph` · status computed `HighIntensityScreenView.ts:862–878`
</details>

<a id="milestones"></a>
**Milestone list** — items appear as the experiment progresses. Each PDOM item has a spoken 🔊 twin announced at the moment the milestone is reached; the item then remains readable here.

<details><summary><b>• Advancing beam</b> — <b>[when source on ∧ playing]</b> — e.g. “Red and black plane wave fronts move toward slitted barrier. Wave peaks, very far apart.” — 🔊 twin fires at source start</summary>

Text is the [beam description](#beam) (varies with wave display × particle color × barrier × peak spacing, ×~30 combinations — see shared block).
🔊 twin: announced after “Source started…” — see [source-restart cascade](#cascade-restart) and [Response index](#response-index).
</details>

<details><summary><b>• Wave behavior after slits</b> — <b>[when past slits ∧ barrier exists]</b> — ×8 — e.g. “Overlapping circular wave fronts add and cancel, and spread checkered pattern toward detector screen.”</summary>

By slit configuration × wave display:

| | Amplitude display | E-field / real / imaginary displays |
|---|---|---|
| both open (interference) | “Overlapping solid circular waves add and cancel, and spread fan-shaped rays toward `{detector screen}`.” | “Overlapping circular wave fronts add and cancel, and spread checkered pattern toward `{detector screen}`.” |
| one covered (diffraction) | “Solid circular wave spreads toward `{detector screen}`.” | “Circular wave fronts spread toward `{detector screen}`.” |
| which-path detectors | “Non-interacting solid circular waves spread toward `{detector screen}`.” | “Non-interacting circular wave fronts spread toward `{detector screen}`.” |

Destination becomes “graph.” **[when graph view]**. (No-barrier scenes never show this item.)
🔊 twin: the same strings announced when the wavefront passes the slits — plus an at-slits stage that is *response-only* (see [wave-progress responses](#r-progress)).

</details>

<details><summary><b>• Hits accumulating</b> — <b>[when hits mode ∧ collecting]</b> — e.g. “Individual scattered hits on detector screen.” — wording advances with hit stage</summary>

Text comes from the [detector pattern matrix — hits mode](#matrix-hits) at the current stage.
🔊 twin: announced each time the hit count crosses a stage threshold ([scale S1](#s1)); duplicates suppressed.
</details>

<details><summary><b>• Completed intensity pattern</b> — <b>[when intensity ∧ pattern complete ∧ screen view]</b> — e.g. “Across detector screen, evenly-spaced bright bands are very close together, brightest at center.”</summary>

Text from the [detector pattern matrix — intensity mode](#matrix-intensity), complete row.
🔊 twin: announced once when formation completes; also a *response-only* announcement when formation starts (“Evenly-spaced bright bands form on detector screen.” family).
</details>

<details><summary><b>• Graph pattern</b> — <b>[when graph view ∧ (hits mode ∨ pattern present)]</b> — e.g. “Graph traces intensity versus position with tall central peak and smaller peaks on either side. 9 peaks centered on the graph, spread symmetrically to either side.”</summary>

Text from the [graph pattern descriptions](#matrix-graph).

<details><summary><b>🔊 Wave-progress responses</b> — response-only, ×~20 — fired per stage change during propagation; “traveling to slits” and “direct to screen” stages are deliberately silent</summary>

- **at slits** — by barrier × display: “Circular wave fronts emerge from both slits and overlap.” (E-field family, both open) / “Solid circular waves emerge from both slits and overlap.” (amplitude) / “…emerges from open slit only.” (one covered) / “As detection events occur, ⟨solid circular waves · circular wave fronts⟩ emerge from both slits one at a time and do not interact.” (which-path)
- **after slits** — the same 8 strings as milestone item 2 (spoken twin)
- **source off** — “Source is off, so no wave is traveling.”

Destination says “graph.” **[when graph view]**. Text dedup: identical consecutive announcements dropped.

🔊 **Max hits** — “Maximum hits reached. Source is off.” — fired when the hit cap is hit; the emitter also turns off. `…maxHitsReached` · trigger `:127–131`

## Qualitative scales — the vocabulary of “how it looks”

Category boundaries live in analysis code, not YAML; they select which string variant renders.

<a id="s1"></a>**S1 · Hit stages** (total hits): none 0 · few 1+ · emerging 188+ · developing 300+ · steady pattern 563+ — `BandAnalysis.ts:51–56`

<a id="s2"></a>**S2 · Band spacing** (fringe spacing ÷ screen width): extremely far apart ≥.50 · very far apart ≥.33 · far apart ≥.16 · somewhat close together ≥.08 · close together ≥.05 · very close together ≥.03 · extremely close together below — default photon pattern tuned to land mid-scale — `BandAnalysis.ts:88–99`. The same seven phrases describe wave-peak spacing in beam descriptions.

<a id="s4"></a>**S4 · Photon color zones** (wavelength): violet · blue · indigo · green · yellow · orange · red — `WavelengthColorUtils.ts`

<a id="s5"></a>**S5 · Envelope** (pattern silhouette): brightest at center · clustering into two close areas · clustering into two distinct areas — heuristic in `BandAnalysis.analyzeEnvelopeHeuristic` (boundary values UNKNOWN — not extracted)

<a id="s6"></a>**S6 · Pattern formation** (intensity mode): empty → forming → complete (formation factor threshold) · paused **[when paused mid-formation]** — `HighIntensityScreenView.ts:133–152`

**Wave progress stages**: source off → traveling to slits *(silent)* → at slits → ⟨interfering · diffracting · non-interacting⟩ after slits → (no barrier: direct to screen, *silent*) — per-frame estimate from propagation speed × elapsed time.

## Generation notes — unresolved in this draft

1. Slit Configuration combo: possible double response (own YAML response vs. screen-level) — needs runtime trace on this screen.
2. ⚠ “Barrier-screen distance is 0 meters” — unit bug, fix pending.
3. ⚠ “a electron experiment” — article bug, fix pending.
4. ⚠ Sim reset response (“Experiment reset…”) defined but never fires — wire or remove.
5. Particle-speed spoken value format (matter scenes) — not exercised.
6. Envelope-category thresholds (S5) — not extracted.
7. Measuring tape / stopwatch interaction strings **[common]** — not captured; harness pass needed with tools added.
8. Preferences dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts dialog contents — out of scope for this screen document.
